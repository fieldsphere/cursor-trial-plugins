# Write Ticket

Create clear, implementation-ready tickets that engineers can execute without follow-up clarification.

## Required Output Structure

1. Title
  - Concise and action-oriented.
  - Include key domain/context.
2. Problem
  - What user or business issue is being solved.
  - Why now and expected impact.
3. Scope
  - In scope and out of scope bullets.
4. Requirements
  - Functional requirements as testable bullets.
  - Non-functional constraints (performance, reliability, security) when relevant.
5. Acceptance Criteria
  - Use `Given/When/Then` or explicit checklist.
  - Include error and edge-case behavior.
6. Technical Notes
  - Relevant systems/services, API endpoints, dependencies, risks.
7. QA Notes
  - Concrete validation steps and sample data.

## Quality Rules

- No emojis in ticket title or body.
- Avoid ambiguous language (for example, "improve", "optimize") without measurable definition.
- Make each requirement independently verifiable.
- Include assumptions explicitly when requirements are incomplete.
